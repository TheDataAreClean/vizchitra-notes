# VizChitra Community Guidelines

_WORKING DRAFT_

## Core Values

We want to build a strong community of interdisciplinary individuals with a shared interest in the practice of data visualisation across India.

The VizChitra community bring the following core values to all our intents and our actions in our work.

1. **Inclusivity**: Welcomes all skill levels and diverse perspectives.
2. **Humanity**: Emphasizes empathy, authenticity, and human connection.
3. **Collaboration**: Fosters knowledge sharing and community growth.
4. **Creativity**: Celebrates the artistic process and values exploration.

## Community Structure 

We follow a volunteer-led and flat membership structure for the community. Currently, there are two groups within the community - _Friends of VizChitra_ & _Core Members_:

1. **Friends of VizChitra**: This is an open membership group where people interested in the community can participate, exchange ideas and get involved. This is the entry point for new members to the community.

2. **Core Members**: These are active members of the community, who are **directly** engaged in driving the work in one of the six main workstreams of the community 
    - Admin & Meta
    - Branding & Marketing
    - Communication & Outreach
    - Discourse & Editorial
    - Events & Conference 
    - Sales & Partnership

**Community Admin**: Three members of the core team are nominated for being the community admin every year. They are the main leads on the _Admin & Meta_ teams. Their primary role involves taking care of the financial, legal, partnership and commnity membership and moderation issues. 


## Code of Conduct

The Doâ€™s and Dont's for being part of the vizchitra community.

This code of conduct applies across online exchanges, conferences and other events hosted by VizChitra community.

We are here as a community to deliberate on the topics of the community.

1. Be nice to everyone,
2. Be empathetic,
3. Be questioning, as it furthers the discussion, but
4. Discuss ideas, not people and their personalities (as that would be ad hominem).

We strongly condemn any kind of harassment of any fellow participant. This includes:

1. Sustained disruption of talks, discussions and other events.
2. Offensive remarks or jokes made about women, men, persons of non-binary genders and those with physical disabilities, or on the basis of sexuality, race, caste or religion.
3. Use of images that objectify the human body unless absolutely relevant to the discussion.
4. Inappropriate physical contact and invasion of private space.
Deliberate intimidation, unwelcome gestures and stalking.

Please report in confidence by sending an email to the community admins. Reports will be treated seriously and community admins will address this matter quickly.

Violators, regardless of their standing, may be expelled from the community, without a refund (where payment was applicable), and reported to the authorities.
